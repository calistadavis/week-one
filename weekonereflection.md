Github Setup

	-Following the week one guidelines in order, this was the first application that I attempted to download.
	-This was also my first experience with anything like this course so I found myself moving slowly through the intructions.
	-The screenshots for this application made the setup of an account simple and understanding of the platform itself.
	-I found the verification activity entertaining.
	-Overall, the terms in general have been my biggest point of confustion so far, so I have been trying my best to focus on only what the guidelines are asking from me.
	-The layout seems to be fairly straightforward, but I am facing formatting issues in terms of typing out notes here. Hopefully this will improve over time!
	-Here I discovered that one submission is notes and the other is a journal so I had to go in and edit the name of this document. 
	
	To do so I:
	1. Settings 
	2. Enter new name in textbook (this was really simple!)
	
Hypothesis Setup

	-The setup for this was fairly straight forward as well.
	-I connected successfully to the hist3814o page.
	-After exploring a bit I discovered some resources that helped me with the other portions of this week, like the file that exemplifies what our notes are to look like.
	-There are still things on this application that I would need to explore to become more comfortable with it. 
	
Zotero Setup

	-I had the most struggle with the setup of this application, although working through the slideshow helped.
	-Downloading it as both a chrome extension and on my windows desktop, I think I managed to gain access to the application.
	-I have done little exploring into what this application will provide for us in the future.
	
Discord

	-This application has already proven beneficial to the completion of the weekly assignments.
	-Being a tech nooby it is great to have a platform to ask questions and discuss processes with other classmates, including where we found success and failures.
